# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard 

Created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset of 3,500+ records from NC State, The Public Science Lab which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. Dashboard and visualizations created using D3, Plotly, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

The deployed site can be found here:
